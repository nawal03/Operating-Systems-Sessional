# Operating Systems Sessional 

This repository contains my sessional work for the Operating Systems course, focusing on hands-on kernel-level programming using the xv6 operating system. The goal was to develop a deeper understanding of OS concepts by working directly with a simple, Unix-like teaching OS.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Before running or modifying `xv6`, make sure to set up the required tools:

ðŸ”— [xv6 Toolchain Setup Instructions](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/tools.html)

## ðŸ§± Base Code

This work is based on the official xv6 codebase:

ðŸ”— [MIT xv6 RISC-V GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv)

To apply any changes from this repository to the original xv6 codebase, use the following command:

```bash
git apply /path/to/some-changes.patch
